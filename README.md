This is my second task in my intenship

Using the 'iris' dataset , predicting the optimum number of clusters and represented it visually 

I also explained the elbow method and compared the 'iris' dataset after preprocessing the data with the original dataset 

CONCLUSION:

Obviously there are only 3 species of Iris, because that's the original (truthful) iris dataset.

The 2-cluster solution seemed good, but in real life the iris dataset has 3 SPECIES (a 3-cluster solution). Therefore, clustering cannot be trusted at all times. Sometimes it seems like x clusters are a good solution, but in real life, there are more (or less).
